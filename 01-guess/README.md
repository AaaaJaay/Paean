# Guessing Games

## guess.py

In this game, the computer will think of a number and we have to find out what it is. We
can input our guess and the computer will tell us if we need to guess higher or lower.
This continues until we guess the number correctly.

## Exercise: Reverse Guess

Create a file `reverse_guess.py`. In reverse guess, you should think of a 
number and the computer should find out what it is. The computer will print
a guess, after which the user will input 'h' if the next guess should be
higher, 'l' if the next guess should be lower or 'c' if the computer guessed
the correct number. 

Here is an example of the expected output, when the user thinks of the number 55:

```
My guess is 44
Enter h/l/c: l
My guess is 79
Enter h/l/c: h
My guess is 50
Enter h/l/c: l
My guess is 55
Enter h/l/c: c
```
